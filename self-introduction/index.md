Hi, my name is Valery. I am twenty eight years old. I am from Belarus, I graduated from Vitebsk Polytechnic College in two thousand fifteen. My major is electrical technician. I am doing electrical measurements

In my free time, from studies and work, I like to play computer games, watch movies, play guitar. My best quality desire for self-development and a responsible attitude to work.

I want to learn a new profession, frontend developer, for this I signed up for courses rsschool where at the moment and learn,I passed the course Stage 0.

The latest project I'm working on is a nonograms game, I used HTML, CSS, JS and webpack to create the game. When creating the project I didn't manage to implement switching the difficulty level, but I really enjoyed making the game.

At this I have all, but to keep up with the time which is specified in the task, I suggest you listen to good music.
