## Reflections

[During the Microsoft course, I learned the basics of TypeScript, which adds strict typing to code, helps identify errors during development, and provides additional features not found in JavaScript. I learned how to type primitive types, create interfaces, type functions, and implement generics. I also discovered additional capabilities for working with classes]
